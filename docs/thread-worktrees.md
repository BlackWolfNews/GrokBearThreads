# A worktree per thread

Mike, 2026-10-27: several threads work on Threadbear at once, all in the
same checkout. One thread's `git add -A` has swept another's half-done work
into a commit, merges and test runs collide, and every agent has to
remember to make its own worktree. Instead, a repo can ask for each new
thread to get a worktree of its own, and a thread lands its branch on main
when its checks pass.

## Opting in

Only repos that ask. A patch (docs/protocol.md, "Patches") can say:

```ts
export default {
  worktree: {
    // Run in the new worktree before the first turn. Optional.
    setup: "cd runner && npm ci --no-audit --no-fund",
    // Run by `tb land` before main moves. Optional; a failure stops it.
    check: "./check.sh --quick",
  },
  // actions, panels, hooks as before
};
```

The first patch in the thread's folder chain with a `worktree` wins (home's
`~/.threadbear/patches/` never counts: worktrees are a repo's choice). The
repo is the git toplevel of the folder the patch is in, and its main
checkout is the one with `main` checked out.

## A new thread

`threads.create` (and `create_thread`, and schedules that start a thread)
for a folder inside an opted-in repo:

1. Makes `git worktree add -b thread/<id8> <parent>/<repo>-threads/<id8>
   main` from the main checkout, where `<id8>` is the first 8 characters of
   the thread id. A leftover folder or branch of that name is an error
   shown in the thread, and the thread starts in the main checkout as
   before.
2. The thread's `cwd` is the same subfolder of the worktree as the folder
   asked for (asking for `~/dev/me/threadbear/runner` gives
   `.../threadbear-threads/<id8>/runner`).
3. `setup` runs in the worktree's root before the first turn starts. Its
   output goes in the transcript as an `action.run` event (`trigger:
   "worktree.setup"`). A failure is shown and the turn starts anyway.
4. The record keeps `worktree: { repo, mainCheckout, path, branch, base }`
   (`base` is main's commit when it was made); the summary carries
   `worktree?: { branch, mainCheckout }` so the app can show it.
5. `threads.create` takes `worktree: false` to start in the folder as
   before.

The agent is told, in the appended system prompt: this thread has its own
worktree of `<repo>` at `<path>` on branch `thread/<id8>`, made from main;
commit there; other threads use other worktrees; when the work is done and
checked, `tb land` puts it on main.

## Landing

`tb land`, run in the thread's worktree (an agent's Bash, or Mike's Land
chip, which is a command action every opted-in thread gets):

1. Refuses with uncommitted changes in the worktree (says which files).
2. `git rebase main` in the worktree. A conflict aborts the rebase and
   says which files; the agent sorts it out and runs `tb land` again.
3. Runs `check` in the worktree, if there is one. A failure stops here,
   with the last lines of its output.
4. `git -C <mainCheckout> merge --ff-only thread/<id8>`. If main's working
   tree has uncommitted changes in files the merge touches, git refuses;
   `tb land` says so and which files, and leaves everything as it was.
5. Prints what landed (`git log --oneline main@{1}..main`).

It never pushes. The runner and the app follow the local main by
themselves.

After landing, the branch stays and the thread can carry on: the next
`tb land` lands only what's new. `tb land --dry-run` does steps 1 to 3 and
says what would land.

## Cleaning up

When a thread with a worktree is archived or deleted: if its branch is
merged into main (or has no commits of its own), the worktree is removed
(`git worktree remove`, `--force` only for untracked files) and the branch
deleted. Otherwise both stay, with a `system.note` saying so and how to
land or drop them. Unarchiving a thread whose worktree was removed starts
its next turn in the main checkout, with a note.

## Not in v1

- Repos that aren't on `main`.
- Moving a thread with a worktree to another folder (allowed, the worktree
  just stays where it is until the thread is archived).
- Showing the branch in the app beyond the summary field.
- Projects (docs/projects-design.md): when patches load from project
  folders, `worktree` still only counts from the thread's own folder chain.
