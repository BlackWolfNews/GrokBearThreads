// The backend's API version: what the runner and the phone app can expect
// from these functions. Bump it when a change adds something a client relies
// on, and change clients to cope with the old number first, since a phone
// from the App Store and an older runner can both meet a newer backend (and
// the other way round) while an update rolls out.
// docs/setup-and-updates.md section 2.3.
//
// The runner checks it against its own BACKEND_API_VERSION (runner/src/sync.ts;
// a unit test keeps the two equal) and says so when its backend is older.
//
// 1: the phone API of 27 Oct (docs/convex-backend.md section 6), plus this
//    number on sync:heartbeat and phone:me.
